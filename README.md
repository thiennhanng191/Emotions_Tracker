# Emotions_Tracker
An Android tablet application allowing user record their emotions and receive suggesstions of useful alternative medicine, using Processing in Java, implementing Android activities.
This is a special project for an elder client for my CMPU203 course - Software Design and Implementation. 

The goal of this project is to allow the client to be able to record his feeling and receive a suggestion of a helpful Bach remedy (for which he is an advocate) that can help alleviate his mood.
He can also use the app to play Bible verses and write about his feelings.
